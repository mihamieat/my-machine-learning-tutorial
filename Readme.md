# My machine learning tutorial
## Overview
This is what I have coded from the machine learning tutorial that can be found [here](https://www.data-transitionnumerique.com/scikit-learn-python/)
## Pre-requisites
We recommend you to install and enable a virtual environment at first.
You can use for instance *virtualenv* and use python 3.9.
Install everything from the requirements file.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
