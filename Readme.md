## Overview
This is what I have coded from the machine learning tutorial that can be found [here](https://www.data-transitionnumerique.com/scikit-learn-python/)
## Pre-requisites
We recommend that you install an enable a virtual environment first.
You can use for instance *virtualenv* and use python 3.9.
