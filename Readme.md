# My machine learning tutorial
## Overview
This is what I have coded from the machine learning tutorial that can be found [here](https://www.data-transitionnumerique.com/scikit-learn-python/)
## Pre-requisites
### Requirement
Python 3.9 and above.
### Install
We recommende you to use a virtual environment before intalling and lauching the scripts.

We recommend you to install Poetry.
Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.

    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
To install dependencies:

### Run a script
To run a script, for instance, do:

    poetry run my_machine_learning/my_machine_learning.py
